                                Award-winning Colombian urbano singer J Balvin is a chart-topping recording artist whose
                                polished urban singles ("Yo Te Lo Dije" and "Mi Gente") and multi-platinum-selling
                                albums (including 2012's La Familia) have not only made him a top-tier Latin pop
                                crossover act, but someone capable of breaking the segregation of the American music
                                industry's language barrier. Balvin is also known for his dozens of collaborations.
                                Beginning with 2011's "Sin Compromiso" (feat. Jowell & Randy), "Ay Vamos" with Nicky Jam
                                and French Montana in 2015, anvd "Sensualidad" with Prince Royce, DJ Luian, Mambo Kingz,
                                and Bad Bunny in 2017, and his spot on Rosalia's chart-topping "Con Altura" in 2019. In
                                addition to chart-topping singles and videos, Balvin has also released best-selling
                                albums, including 2018's Vibras, and the following year's full-length collaboration with
                                Bad Bunny on Oasis. Balvin's success has made him one of the most recognizable members
                                of the second generation of reggaeton artists and a trendsetter for new and high
                                fashion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Born José Álvaro Osorio Balvin in Medellín, Colombia, he became interested in music at a
                                young age while listening to rap, champeta, bachata, and reggae on the radio. He was
                                also a big fan of music videos; it was from these that he began to develop his dance
                                moves and cultivate his own style.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He signed to EMI Colombia in 2009 and released his first single, "Ella Me Cautivó,"
                                which charted at 35 on the U.S. tropical chart. This was followed by the release of the
                                full-length Real in 2010. Balvin contributed four tunes to the soundtrack of the Tim
                                Bulot film El Negocio. All of them charted, including "En Lo Oscuro," which hit the top
                                spot in his native country.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Balvin was a featured vocalist on the Colombian version of Robin Thicke's smash single
                                "Blurred Lines," which was issued in October of 2013, just prior to his own second
                                album, La Familia. All four singles from the album charted in Colombia's Top Ten, and
                                "Yo Te Lo Dije" hit number two on the rhythm chart and number nine on the Latin pop
                                chart in the U.S. The B Sides collection appeared in September of 2014, featuring two
                                more radio chart-topping singles in "6 AM" and "Ay Vamos." The latter won a Latin Grammy
                                for Best Urban Song.

                                His 2015 single "Ginza," the official pre-release for his next album, entered the Hot
                                Latin Songs chart at number one, topped several others, and was certified platinum.
                                Balvin's collaborations were as notable as his own work that year. He and Julión Álvarez
                                were featured on Juan Gabriel's single "La Frontera." His "Latino Remix" of Justin
                                Bieber's smash "Sorry" scored big for both artists at Latin pop radio and in digital
                                streaming and downloads.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 2016, Balvin won the Premios Lo Nuestro Artist of the Year Award and was a featured
                                guest on both Sofia Carson's charting debut single, "Love Is the Name," and on Alejandro
                                Sanz's "Cuando Seas Grande" -- from a performance at La Voz -- along with Gloria Trevi
                                and Los Tigres del Norte. In May he released the single "Bobo"; it topped the Latin
                                songs chart. "Safari," featuring Pharrell Williams, BIA, and Sky, was released in June,
                                followed by the full-length Energia. The album, produced by Sky and featuring
                                contributions from Bull Nene, Daddy Yankee, Fuego, Yandel, and Juanes, hit the top spot
                                on several Latin album charts. The following year, he scored a hit with a remix of his
                                track "Mi Gente" that featured Beyoncé. The song became his first U.S. Top Ten single.

                                Balvin kicked off 2018 with a handful of collaborative singles: "Machika" with Jeon and
                                Anitta; "X" with Nicky Jam; and Cardi B's "I Like It" with Bad Bunny. After leading the
                                2018 Billboard Latin Music Awards finalists' list with nominations in 12 categories,
                                Balvin announced the May release of the 14-track Vibras, his fifth long-player. Working
                                again with producer Alejandro Ramírez (aka Sky Rompiendo el Bajo), who has been his
                                musical partner since La Familia, the set moved reggaeton in new directions and sounds
                                as it played host to a slew of guests including Carla Morrison, Wisin y Yandel, Zion y
                                Lennox, L.A.-based flamenco singer Rosalía, Brazilian pop star Anitta, and Aruban singer
                                Jeon. Vibras debuted at number 15 in the Top 200 -- the highest-charting debut for any
                                Latin album -- and number one at both the Top Latin Albums and Latin Album Sales the
                                week of release. Sales earned Balvin platinum status in the United States and
                                multi-platinum status in Mexico and Colombia. In addition, the recording placed at
                                either number one or two on various global streaming outlets. Riding the success of the
                                album, Balvin threw himself into touring and working with other artists.

                                During the first half 2019 he made several more Hot 100 appearances: He collaborated
                                with Benny Blanco, Tainy, and Selena Gomez on "I Can't Get Enough," with Ozuna, Daddy
                                Yankee, Farruko, and Anuel AA, on the smash "Baila Baila Baila." In early May he and El
                                Guincho appeared on Rosalia's Top Ten hit "Con Altura," and later that month on DJ
                                Khaled's "You Stay," alongside Meek Mill, Lil Baby, and Jeremih. In June, the album
                                Oasis by Balvin and fellow urbano prince Bad Bunny was released without advance notice.
                                Saturated in dembow and trap beats and crafted specifically as a soundtrack for
                                summertime, it entered at number one on the Latin Rhythm charts two weeks after release
                                and debuted at number nine on the Top 200. The album's first single, "Que Pretendes,"
                                entered the Hot 100 as well. The set peaked at number one on the Top Latin albums chart
                                and at nine on the Top 200. It was chosen by publications ranging from the New York
                                Times to Rolling Stone and Billboard as one of the top Latin titles of the year. Oasis
                                was certified double platinum (Latin) by the RIAA. In all, between collaborations and
                                his own titles as a leader, Balvin appeared on and/or recorded 22 singles in 2019. Among
                                them was his collaboration with Rosalia, "Con Altura" feat. El Guincho. Its video racked
                                up 1.5 billion views. In February of 2020, Balvin delivered the charting single
                                "Morado." He announced the March 2020 release of his fifth album, Colores, a concept
                                offering wherein each of its ten songs corresponds to a different color with
                                accompanying videos directed by Colin Tilley. The album cover featured psychedelic
                                imagery from Japanese artist Takashi Murakami. Produced by Sky Rompiendo, the set was
                                preceded by the Rojo EP that contained two of the album's tracks in "Blanco" and
                                "Morado." Colores was released in March of 2020. ~ Thom Jurek, Rovi
